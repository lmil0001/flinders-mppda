      <p>The MPPDA Digital Archives consists of a database of the extant records
      of the General Correspondence files of the Motion Picture Producers and
      Distributors of America, Inc., covering the period from 1922 to 1939.
      Established in 1922, the MPPDA was the trade association for the motion
      picture industry, and included all the major companies producing and
      distributing motion pictures in the United States in its membership. The
      association was popularly known as the Hays Office, after its first
      President, Will H. Hays, who remained office until 1945. Hays was a leading
      Republican party politician, who resigned from President Warren Harding’s
      Cabinet to take up the MPPDA position. After Hays’ retirement, the association
      was renamed the Motion Picture Association of America.</p>
      
      <p>The documents in the MPPDA’s General Correspondence files are an immensely
      rich source of information about the history of the motion picture industry.
      They describe the organization and operation of the industry’s trade association,
      and include extensive correspondence and other documentation relating to
      industry policy and public relations, distributor-exhibitor relations,
      censorship and self-regulation. The great majority of this material is
      unavailable from other sources.</p>
